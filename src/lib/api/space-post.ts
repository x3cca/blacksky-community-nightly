 * the Blacksky community feed's three-step write (submit to the appview, write
 * a public stub, admit to the feed generator), and none of those steps exist
 * here. A space post is one ordinary `app.bsky.feed.post` written into the
 * author's own permissioned repo; the syncer materialises it into the feed.
 *
 * Records are built as raw JSON rather than through typed builders, because a
 * reply within a space refers to space URIs, which are not valid at-uris and
 * would fail SDK-side validation.
